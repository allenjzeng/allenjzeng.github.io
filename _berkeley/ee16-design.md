description: >
  Project RoboCar is our knowledge-culminating final project for the EE16 series. The project tasked a
  team of 5 members to build a mobile robot on 3 wheels (2 drivable) that moved around according to
  some input command. It uses the MSP430 Launchpad as its guts with some circuitry for driving the
  motor and sensing through a microphone. In our version of the project, the microphone was used to
  recognize 4 different voice commands, which would then make the robot move forward (fast or slow),
  left or right. The project incorporated elements from circuit design, signal processing, classification,
  and control theory.

I wanted to include a video of the car driving with voice commands, but it's been lost to the sands of time ~ ~ ~
