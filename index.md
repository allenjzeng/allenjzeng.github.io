Thank you for visiting my page! This is a hybrid resume and portfolio, highlighting various projects I've worked on professionally and at school.

Please excuse the (virtual) dust, this website is still under construction! Feel free to contact me if you want to learn more about whichever project has not been fully written up yet.

On the top of the screen, you can search for specific projects or topics using the search icon üîç.

On the sidebar over on the left, you'll see various links including my resume, work experience, and school portfolio. Just by the nature of proprietary work, there are fewer catchy visualizations there as compared to my projects from UC San Diego and Berkeley.

- [Resume](/resume/) contains a long-form webpage resume, as well as the short-form PDF resume that you might already be familiar with.
- [Toyon Research Corp](/work/) describes (in plain text) various projects that I've contributed to and led at Toyon.
- [Grad Projects](/ucsd/) contains a list of projects that I've worked on while at UC San Diego.
- [Undergrad Projects](/berkeley/) contains a list of projects that I've worked on while at UC Berkeley.
- [Presentations](/presentations/) contains the slides for various presentations that I've given, as a startup pitch, tutorial/workshop, etc. that do not necessarily fall into the above categories.
